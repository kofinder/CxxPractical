# Template Meta-Programming

- **Template Meta-Programming is fast (runtime)**  
  Template Metaprogramming is computed at compile-time, meaning nothing is computed at run-time.

- **Template Meta-Programming is Turing Complete**  
  Template Metaprogramming is capable of expressing all tasks that a standard programming language can accomplish.

- **Template Meta-Programming requires longer compile time**  
  Template recursion heavily slows down the compile time and requires much more memory than compiling standard code.

- **Template Meta-Programming is complex**  
  Everything is expressed recursively, making it hard to read, write, and also very hard to debug.

# Fundamental Principles of OOP

**Class** - A blueprint or template that defines the structure (data members) and behavior (methods) of objects.

**Object** - A specific instance of a class, representing a concrete example of the structure defined by that class.

**Instance** - Another term for an object; it emphasizes that this is a specific occurrence of a class.

**Instantiating** - The process of creating an object from a class.

**Data Members** - Variables that hold data or state for the object.

**Methods** - Functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions the object can perform.

**Abstraction** - The concept of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features.

**Encapsulation** - The practice of restricting direct access to some of an object's components, allowing access only through well-defined public interfaces (methods).

**Inheritance** - A mechanism that allows a class (derived class or child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (base class or parent class).

**Polymorphism** - The ability to treat different object types (that share the same base type) as instances of their common base class, allowing for methods to behave differently based on the object being referenced.

# Keys Concept Of OOP

**Class** - Describes the structure of an object.

**Object** - A specific example (instance) of that structure.

**Instance** - Another name for an object.

**Instantiating** - Creating an object from a class.

**Data Members** - Variables that hold the state of an object.

**Methods** - Functions defined within a class.

**Abstraction** - A concept that simplifies complexity by hiding intricate details.

**Encapsulation** - Granting access to private data only through controlled public interfaces (methods).

**Inheritance** - The ability to create derived classes that inherit properties from their parent class.

**Polymorphism** - The ability to treat objects of different classes as if they are instances of a common base class.
